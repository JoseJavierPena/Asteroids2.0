There's some comments on the program in App.cpp that needs attention, need to overload the operator = to pass the models to the var.
Need to change when the ship is colliding with an asteroid in order to erase a life of the ship.
Need to change when adding more asteroids, and the position of the ship and the asteroids after creating lots of asteroids.

Need some refactor to make a better game.
